# Apple II HGR2 Grid - Svelte Version
This is a simple little page that superimposes a 280x192 grid (the Apple II's HGR2 pixel dimensions) on top of an uploaded image, and a tooltip in each grid area that provides its X,Y co-ordinates on hover. You can toggle the visibility of the grid.  

Users should resize images prior to upload to match the graphics mode's 7:5 aspect ratio.
